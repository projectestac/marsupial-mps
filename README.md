"Marsupial" is a set of protocols defined by the Ministry of Education of Catalonia in the context of the 1-to-1 program *educat1x1 - eduCAT 2.0*.

Marsupial has been also adopted as a main interoperability protocol in the *Punto Neutro de Recursos Educativos Digitales* platform, promoted by the Spanish Ministry of Education.

The target of Marsupial is to facilitate the communication between Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) and on-line commercial textbooks provided by publishers.
